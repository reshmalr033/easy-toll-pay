easy pay toll while travelling 
Toll collection is the process of the collection of toll fees on roads and bridges. 
In the present days, the process of toll collection is a manual one.
An individual designated as a toll collector is positioned at a strategic point where it is possible to collect the fee or charge from anyone who wishes to cross the bridge or continue along the road. 
The collector is normally housed in a tollbooth that is situated at the entryway of the bridge or the beginning of the toll road. 
In this context, they require vehicles to stop, pay the toll amount and collect the balance.
Manual toll collection wastes time and raises vehicle operating costs.
Here arises the need of our project “E-Toll with Easy Pay”. 
Here we use E- toll collection system.
